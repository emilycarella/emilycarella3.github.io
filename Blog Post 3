## Who's Doing It Right: Universal Healthcare ##

We've talked about the importance of affordable and universal healthcare in the United states, so now let's take a closer look at other countries who have achieved this goal. First of all, universal healthcare is not the same thing as "free healthcare". Many people get the two confused, thinking that they are interchangeable, or that every country that has universal healthcare also has free healthcare, and vice versa. Actually, it is quite the contrary. Universal and free healthcare are two vastly different things. Some countries that have one may also have the other, but that is not always the case. If a country  has "universal healthcare", that typically means that their system provides healthcare and financial protection to all people. Basically, they provide an insurance package to their citizens with the goal of providing improved services and outcomes from the healthcare system, while also protecting individuals and families from the financial risk that comes with seeking these services. It is not a one-size-fits-all system, but it does specify who is covered, what is covered, and how much of the cost is covered. As opposed to universal healthcare, free healthcare exists in countries where primary healthcare is publicly funded and is free or of very little cost to its citizens regardless of income or wealth.

Universal healthcare is typically implemented in a few different ways. Most countries that have implemented universal healthcare use a mixed-model system, where coverage is funded both publicly and privately, using tax revenue as the main source. However, some countries use either single-payer or multipayer system. In a single payer system, a country's government bears the weight of all healthcare costs. The single payer system may not be favorable for larger countries where there is a lot of wealth disparity, because the coverage is need based and the need is then decided by the government. In a multipayer system, healthcare is funded publicly and privately. Most of the private non-government funding in these systems comes from employer and employee and is pooled in regulated non-profit sickness funds called "compulsory insurance".

# So Who is doing This? #
Well, the first country to try their hand at providing universal healthcare to its citizens was Germany, when in 1883 they set in motion the Sickness Insurance Law that required employers to cover injury and sickness costs of low-wage workers. It was not until after World War II however, that universal healthcare became a mainstream trend that many countries wanted to imitate. It started mostly with southern and western European countries (like the United Kingdom) when in 1970-2000 they began implementing universal coverage. Following their example, many Asian and South American countries followed suit. Today, most first and second world countries provide either universal or free healthcare to their citizens. Most notably, Canada provides universal healthcare to their citizens throught the single-payer system described above. Most European countries, namely the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy use a mixed-model multipayer system that uses mostly tax revenue to fund healthcare. These Western European countries use the revenue gained from these systems to provide preventative and public healthcare that is regulated by the Ministry of Health. There is then a mix of public and private providers who offer specified benefit packages to cover private citizens.

# What's the United States Doing? #
Although past administrations have tried and tried again to push universal healthcare in the United States, the country currently uses a private health insurance system. Companies keep competitive rates and offer different coverage packages to private citizens. In this kind of system, insurance companies usually exclude many health conditions that are expensive to cover in order to keep rate low for their customers. This means that some people may have higher payment rates, or may be unable to obtain coverage at all based on factors that are often out of their control. for example, many cancers and muscular diseases fall under this category of pre-existing conditions that are not covered by some insurance plans. In countries with universal healthcare, the government usually tries to limit these. The Obama administration tried to do this with the Affordable Care Act.
So who else does not have universal or free healthcare?

Well, the United States sits along side an array of third world countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Comoros, and Mozambique. Most middle eastern countries also do not have universal or free healthcare, such as Iraq, Iran, Jordan, and Lebanon. The only country whose development sits on the same plane as the United States and who does not have universal or free healthcare is China, who is governed by communists. Most other countries as developed as the United States have found a way to provide either universal or free healthcare to all their citizens. Isn't it time that the richest country on the planet and leader of the free world does as well?
