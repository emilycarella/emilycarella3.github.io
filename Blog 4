## Why hasn't the government been able to agree on healthcare reform? ##


So many countries have been able to provide free or affordable healthcare to their citizens, so why is it so hard for the United States government to do what so many others already have? Most politicians agree that we need a way to provide affordable healthcare to all citizens, but the main problems they have been facing lie in the logistics of the multiple bills they have tried to pass. Who will be covered, what will be covered, and most controversial of all: Who will pay? In my previous post, I went over the different types of payment models that are most popular for countries with universal healthcare. Some work better than other, like the multipayer system as opposed to the single payer system. The reason our congress has not been able to agree on a plan is based mostly on the fact that the Republican and Democratic parties cannot agree on which system to use. One side wants to tax the rich, while the other does not think that the burden of healthcare funding should fall solely on one social group. The other issue falls on how to determine who gets healthcare funding. Should it be need based, or should it be accessible to all citizens regardless of social class.

Finally, the most complicated issue comes in deciding WHAT should be covered. Should only basic needs be covered? Should all healthcare be covered? Should insurance even people who prove to be high risk? This is where pre-existing conditions come in. Private insurance companies have traditionally been able to raise the rates of those people who have any disease or malady that is considered "pre-existing". These conditions make the patient much more expensive to cover than the average person. However, pre-existing conditions are not necessarily uncommon, and under Trumpcare, they may not even be regulated. Based on released documents outlining pre-existing conditions, many cancers fall under this category, as well as pregnancy, some muscular dystrophies and diseases of the nervous system. A lot of these conditions seem unavoidable, and a lot of people think it is outrageous that they can prevent someone from insurance coverage.
